# AgenticBot: Multi-Agent Chatbot Framework with Crew AI, FastAPI, and Streamlit

AgenticBot is a **dynamic and intelligent chatbot framework** designed to handle complex user interactions using **multi-agent collaboration**. The framework leverages **Crew AI** for agent orchestration, **FastAPI** for backend processing, and **Streamlit** for a seamless interactive UI.

The chatbot efficiently handles **query refinement**, **response validation**, **summarization**, and **feedback analysis** while offering an **optional ticket creation workflow** for service desk or IT support scenarios.

The framework is designed using a **modular agentic approach** where each agent specializes in a specific task:

1. **Supervisor Agent:** Handles query refinement and clarification.  
2. **Validation Agent:** Verifies the accuracy and relevance of responses.  
3. **Summarization Agent:** Provides a concise and structured response.  
4. **Feedback Agent:** Analyzes user satisfaction and suggests ticket creation if necessary.  
5. **Ticket Agent (Addon):** Generates structured summaries for ticketing when triggered.
